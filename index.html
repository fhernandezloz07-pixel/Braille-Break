  Description:
  This is a Calculator project for me to learn basic HTML, css, and Java principles.
  The code will include a general Calculator where the user can make simple order of operations calculations.
  The code will also include another calculator where the user can make more complicated operations with calculus principles.
  If both of the calculators are done accurately, the code will also integrate audio features for various purposes:
       - Aesthetic purposes
       - So a person that is sight impaired can have access to the answer through audio generation of the answer.
  If all three of these are done sucessfully I will then attemt to make it pleasing to the eye.
  Objectives: 
  1. LEARNING! These languages are foreign to me so I want to use this project to learn more about the languages
       - I will use a lot of commenting to aid my learning and hopefully make it easier for beginners to follow my code!
  2. Create a calculator that anybody can use, even if you have trouble seeing!
  3. Have fun, this is my first project on gitHub and I just want to enjoy the process for future projects.
